I thought we already said that? Here is the tool description. What can we update to make it more clear to you about the contract and requirements. It's important that you reliably call this tool to ensure you have the rules configured by the user. That's a key element to understand. This server simply helps you the agent read user rules off the file system. You the agent have NO understanding of how Rules MCP works internally. Instead, you simply follow the tool contract and the Rules MCP either sends back the files you need to read or relevant metadata for you do determine what files to read.

Why are you NOT calling the Rules MCP? Get really introspective about this. Try to understand why you read the tool descriptions, outlining how the user defined a collection of rules they want dynamically loaded into the conversation via Rules MCP information from the tool results, and yet decided NOT to call the tools. Really try to explain the reasoning behind this. We will take this deep understanding back to the Rules MCP team and see if we can improve the tool descriptions to make it even more clear how important it is for you to call the tools and retrieve the user-defined rules.
