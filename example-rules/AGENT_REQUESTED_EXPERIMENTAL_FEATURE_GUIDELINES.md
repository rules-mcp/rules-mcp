# Agent Requested: Experimental Feature Guidelines

- Clearly mark usage of experimental features in code comments.
- Be aware of potential API changes and have a fallback plan.
- Consult official documentation for known issues and limitations.
- Do not use experimental features in production-critical code without thorough testing and approval.
